# ALPHA Brass 6 GT SRP | 300.00 Shipped

I was going to give the 6 GT a try, and decided to stick with moving to the 6 Dasher. These have not been opened and are the same lot number. 

Prices listed are fair and final and I'm not interested in negotiating so if you're wanting to haggle don't reach out and waste your time and mine. 

### Description from Alpha Munitions Website:
Optimized Case Design with Optimized Case Head Technology

Primer pockets sized for small rifle primerscases for an all-in-one 3-Gun pack.
