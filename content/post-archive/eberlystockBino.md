# Large Scout Bino Pack | Color: Skye Camo | SOLD
### Never been used...just out of the packaging.

Here you go. I was not paying attention when I ordered this bino pack thinking it was a small. I didn't realize that it was for full size glass until recently as I started preparing for the hunting season. The aformentioned slip pocket can hold a carry handgun but it puts it up pretty high for a quick grab. I chose to carry elsewhere.

### Description from Eberlystock's website 
The Scout Bino Pack™ is an ultralight binocular harness and carrier system designed with a minimalistic mindset. It features a magnetic closure to make it easy and quiet to access your binos. There’s a quick-access slip pocket on the backside to hold a handgun or rangefinder. The improved 3D mesh harness is comfortable and breathable and can be worn under a pack or removed to use the APSK Chest Pouch Mount Kit™
