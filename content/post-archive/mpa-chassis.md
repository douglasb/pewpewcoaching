## MPA Hybrid Stock | SOLD

I was thinking about building a rifle for hunting, but I've decided to go another route. This is an awesome right-handed chassis and given it was part of the last years MPA Granade sale, the perfect fit for someone, just not me.  Never been used and action screws are included.

Prices listed are fair and final and I'm not interested in negotiating so if you're wanting to haggle don't reach out and waste your time and mine.
