## Annealeeze Version 2 | SOLD

This is a dependable unit that knocks out 100 rounds with little need for attention. I would routinely work on other projects at the bench while running the unit. I had some issues keeping the flame consistent using the small propane canisters so I would recommend hooking it up to a larger tank.

Prices listed are fair and final and I'm not interested in negotiating so if you're wanting to haggle don't reach out and waste your time and mine.
